============
Installation
============

It is always a good idea to install your packages to a virtual environment. This is a reminder of how to create one
using the standard `venv` module in python 3 (inside a folder alled workspace)::

$ mkdir workspace; cd workspace
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

To check that you are in your newly created environment run the following commands depending on your OS.
In windows machines::

$ where python

In *nix/macos machines::

$ which python

In both cases you should find that python is running from venv/bin within your workspace folder.

After creating your venv, it is recommended to update pip::

$ pip install -U pip


Stable release
--------------

To install negmas, run this command in your terminal::

$ pip install negmas

This is the preferred method to install negmas, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

correct virtual environment.
