    "\n",
    "Developing a new mechanism for negmas is as easy as overriding a single method. In most cases though, a base class for \n",
    "negotiators compatible with this protocol needs to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for creating a new mechanism in `NegMAS` is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new `Mechanism` class and override the `round()` method to implement a single round of your protocol. \n",
    "   Optionally override the `__init__` function to provide a constructor to initialize your mechanism. Define any\n",
    "   `requirements` of your mechanism that must be satisfied by negotiators using `add_requirements()` during consturciton\n",
    "    (i.e. in the `__init__` method).\n",
    "2. Create a new `Negotiator` class that has `abstractmethod(s)` for any methods called by your custom mechanism class\n",
    "   (usually in the `round()` method). This will be the base class of all negotiators compatible with this new \n",
    "   mechanism. Set any *capabilities* for this new negotiator base class in its `__init__` method using \n",
    "   `add_capabilities()` \n",
    "3. Optionally create a new `MechanismState` `dataclass` with any extra state information that the mechanism will pass to\n",
    "   negotiators and override the `extra_state()` method of your mechanism class to return a dict representation of this\n",
    "   extra state (you will see an example later in this tutorial). Moreover, you will need to change the `state_factory` \n",
    "   argument passed to the `Mechechanism` constructor to use this newly created state type. This step is optional \n",
    "   and is only needed if extra-state needs to be passed to negotiators through the `state` method. It t is recommended \n",
    "   to keep all variable publicly accessible information of the mechanism in its state variable. This way, the history of\n",
    "   the mechanism state will be accessible through the `history` property after the mechanism run.\n",
