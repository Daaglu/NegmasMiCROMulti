    "\n",
    "The most important callbacks that your class is expected to override to be useful as a factory manager are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``init()`` Called after the world is initialized, but before any simulation steps.\n",
    "- ``step()`` Called in the simulation loop. Simulates one step of the agent’s logic. You can use this call to be *proactive*.\n",
    "- ``on_new_cfp()`` Called whenever a new Call for Proposals (CFP) is published on the bulletin board. The agent can specify a condition (e.g., buy CFPs only) such that only those CFPs that satisfy this condition will trigger this callback. By default your agent will only receive CFPs about products that it can use for production or can produce. You can override that by changing the ``insteresting_products`` property of your agent (probably in ``init()``). This callback can be used for implementing *reactive* behavior.\n",
    "- ``on_cfp_removed()`` Called whenever a CFP is removed from the bulletin board.\n",
    "- ``on_negotiation_request_accepted()/on_negotiation_request_rejected()`` Called when a negotiation request initiated by the agent is accepted/rejected.\n",
    "- ``on_negotiation_success()``/``on_negotiation_failure()`` Called when a negotiation the agent is involved in terminates.\n",
    "- ``sign_contract()`` Called by the simulator when it is time to sign a contract. The agent can refuse to sign. By default, agents sign the contract.\n",
    "- ``on_contract_signed()``/``on_contract_canelled()`` Called when a contract the agent is party to is signed/cancelled (contracts will be canceled if any of the partners party to it refused to sign it).\n",
    "- ``on_production_failure()`` Called whenever a production command scheduled by the agent cannot be executed (e.g. for lack of funds or need of input products).\n",

    "\n",
    "The agent can act by calling various methods of its ``awi`` member (Agent World Interface). The most important of these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``request_negotiation()`` Requests a negotiation with another partner\n",
    "- ``register_cfp()`` / ``remove_cfp()`` Registers/removes a call for proposals indicating interest in buying/selling some product and giving the negotiation issues (e.g. deliver time, unit cost, quantity, penalty, signing delay).\n",
    "- ``evaluate_insurance()`` / ``buy_insurance()`` Gets the insurance premium for some potential contract or buys one\n",
    "- ``execute()`` Executes an action in the world. The only supported actions are scheduling a production process to run at some future time-step, stopping (or canceling) a previously issued run command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can also access some useful information through its ``awi``'s properties. Some of the most important such properties are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``state`` The state of the factory giving its current storage, cash in wallet, and standing loans as well as all scheduled production commands.\n",
    "- ``n_steps`` World simulation length\n",
    "- ``current_step`` Current world simulation step\n",
    "- ``products``/``processes`` Information about products/processes defined in this world (these are also accessible through local properties of the ``FactoryManager``\n",
    "- ``cfps`` All calls for proposals currently published in the bulletin board\n",
    "- ``breaches`` All breaches currently published in the bulletin board"
